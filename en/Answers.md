1. Android apps are made of **Screens**. You've created your first question on one **Screen** and you're going to want to add more. You'll put them on new screens, but you need a way of keeping score between those screens. On this card, you'll be adding a **TinyDB** database to keep the score in, and some code to mark the right answer!
2. First, in the **Palette** under **Storage** find the **TinyDB** component and drag it on to the **Viewer**. You won't see anything new there, but *TinyDB1* should appear in the **Components** section.

3. Now it's time to start putting together the code that will power your quiz! In the top right of the screen, click on the **Blocks** button to access the blocks view.
