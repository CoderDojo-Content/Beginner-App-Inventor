1. These cards are going to introduce you to App Inventor, which will let you build apps for Android phones and tablets. You're going to build a quiz that keeps score as the player goes through it. You can use any questions and answers you like, maybe about your favourite band, a sport you play, movies or a tv show you love, but I'm going to do mine on dogs \(I like dogs\).
2. If you want to follow along with me, you're welcome to, if not then wherever I have a doggy themed question, you'll have to come up with your own question, the right answer, and some answers that sound right!
3. Once you've learned these techniques, you can apply them to create more than just a quiz! These same coding tools can be used to make a complete interactive story, or to build a calculator, or a whole bunch of other cool apps.
