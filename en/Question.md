1. You can see that the App Inventor **Designer** view is broken into four key sections:
  * **Palette**—from which you pick the components you will use to build your app
  * **Viewer**—where you can see the app you are working on, rearrange and select components
  * **Components**—where you can see a list of the components in your app and their relationships to each other
  * **Properties**—where you can see and change the properties of the component you have selected at the moment
  
  There are other buttons and even another view, but this is all you'll be using right now.
2. First, drag a **Label** component into the viewer to use for your question.![](/assets/Label.png)
3. To make this **Label** have the question you want to ask in it first select it by clicking on it, either in the **Viewer** or the **Components** section. Now, in the **Properties** section, look for **Text** (you may have to scroll down)![](/assets/Properties-text.png)
